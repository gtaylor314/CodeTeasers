# Power Function Without Using the Multiplication (*) Operator
Working through the various different methods of taking two integers (a and b) and calculating a^b (a to the b power)

## Methods
The methods explored are 1) using a nested for loop and addition, 2) using recursion and addition, and 3) using properties of logarithms and addition. In all cases, a can be positive or negative but b is assumed to be positive.

# Addition Without Using the Plus (+) Operator
Working through the various different methods of adding two values without using the plus operator. 

## Methods
The methods explored are 1) subtracting the opposite of the second number, 2) using the ++ and -- (increment and decrement) operators, 3) using half-adder logic, 4) using logarithms and exponentiation, and 5) using fmt.Printf() and format specifiers to return a + b number of bytes written. The last method requires that both a and b are positive.
